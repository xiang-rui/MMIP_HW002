Medical images are typically represented with high spatial resolution and high bit depth, resulting in considerable storage and transmission demands. In addition, diagnostically important information is often localized within specific regions, making uniform compression strategies inefficient for clinical applications. To address these challenges, this project focuses on the design of a progressive and region-of-interest (ROI)- aware transform-domain codec for medical image compression. In this project, a block-based discrete cosine transform (DCT) is employed to decorrelate spatial information and concentrate signal energy into low-frequency coefficients. Progressive spectral coding is employed, in which transform coefficients are partitioned and transmitted in multiple stages, progressing from low to high frequencies, thereby enabling coarse-to-fine image reconstruction and early visualization. To preserve diagnostically relevant structures, an ROI-aware quantization scheme is applied, where finer quantization steps are assigned to ROI blocks, and coarser quantization is used for non-ROI regions. The quantized coefficients are then serialized using zigzag scanning and further compressed through run-length encoding, followed by canonical Huffman coding to exploit statistical redundancy. Experimental evaluations conducted on synthetic medical phantom images demonstrate that effective progressive reconstruction is achieved and that reconstruction quality within the ROI is significantly improved compared to non-ROI-aware compression. In contrast, comparable global image quality and bitstream size are maintained. These results indicate that the approach developed in this project provides a practical and interpretable solution for medical image compression with diagnostic relevance.
